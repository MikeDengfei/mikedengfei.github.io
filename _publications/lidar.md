title: "LiDAR Based Navigable Region Detection for Unmanned Surface Vehicles"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/lidar
excerpt: 'We propose a scheme to process 3D LiDAR data to achieve an accurate and robust navigable regions detection. We conduct field experiments in a narrow river in different scenarios to prove the performance of the proposed scheme, which reaches on average 93.8% precision and 92.7% recall.'
